<h1 class="beginning"> Hi, I'm Billy </h1>

I was born in 1997. I work as a frontend engineer. Developing is one of my habits. I make open source contributions and became a part of [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) core team.

I'm going to share some experiences here. It might help myself organize my thoughts and learn. I'm from Taiwan, so English is not my first language. Please don't hesitate to correct me if I'm wrong.
