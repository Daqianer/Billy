# Hi, I'm Billy.

Work as a frontend engineer. I was born in 1997. Since I've just graduated, I'm temporarily serving in mandatory military service. In my spare time, I make open source contributions and became a part of [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) core team.

I'm going to share some experiences here. It might help myself organize my thoughts and learn. I'm from Taiwan, so English is not my first language. Please don't hesitate to correct me if I'm wrong.
