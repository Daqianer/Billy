# Hi, I'm Billy.

Work as a frontend engineer. I was born in 1997. Since I've just graduated, I'm waiting to fulfill mandatory military service. In my spare time, I make open source contributions and became a part of [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress) core team.

I'm going to share some experiences at this place. It might help me organize my thoughts and learn. Writing with both Chinese and English to improve not only coding but also language skills. If there's anything wrong, please don't hesitate to correct me.
